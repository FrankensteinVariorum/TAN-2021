<xml>“You have been ill, very ill, and even the constant letters of dear kind Henry are not
    sufficient to reassure me on your account. You are forbidden to write—to hold a pen; yet
    one word from you, dear Victor, is necessary to calm our apprehensions. For a long time
    I have thought that each post would bring this line, and my persuasions have restrained
    my uncle from undertaking a journey to Ingolstadt. I have prevented his encountering the
    inconveniences and perhaps dangers of so long a journey; yet how often have I regretted
    not being able to perform it myself! I figure to myself that the task of attending on
    your sick bed has devolved on some mercenary old nurse, who could never guess your
    wishes, nor minister to them with the care and affection of your poor cousin. Yet that
    is over now: Clerval writes that indeed you are getting better. I eagerly hope that you
    will confirm this intelligence soon in your own handwriting.</xml>
