    this fear, and we shall be the happiest creatures in the world. Your father’s health is
    now so vigorous, that he appears ten years younger since last winter. Ernest also is so
    much improved, that you would hardly know him: he is now nearly sixteen, and has lost
    that sickly appearance which he had some years ago; he is grown quite robust and
    active.&lt;/xml&gt;
